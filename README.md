# MSCdes
research on CUDA, OCL, DES/3DES, crypto

Play with and explore:
- SIMD architecture for current GPUS AMD/Nvidia
- Vulnerabilities in 3DES, possible points of attack/procedures
- DES implementation over GPU via CUDA/OpenCL
- Optimization options via bitsplicing
- Decisive architecture developments for mapping logical operations and corresponding optimizations (keyword: "LOP3")
- Familiarization with CUDA, OpenCL

This is exclusively about evaluation and corresponding code, the respective ideas for implementation are not up to my crap, mostly academic studies and theories are involved - corresponding documents and code snippets can be found publicly and are attached unchanged.

This project is to be understood at most as a treasure trove or collection for those who are interested.
